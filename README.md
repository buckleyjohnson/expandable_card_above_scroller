# expandable_card_above_scroller

A new Flutter application.

Shows an expandable card-like box above a scolling list of images.

Todo: make the text grow/shrink along with the box instead of instantly changing.  Also, do a better job of dynamically sizing the box based on screen size and amount of text, that is, don't brute force it.
